[Cozy Light](http://cozy-labs.github.io/cozy-light) allows you to deal, without effort, with many self-hosting use cases
like turning your server into a file storage, hosting your static website or
managing dockerized web apps. You can try it on your desktop or directly set it
up on your own server. It performs well on cheap hardwares like the Raspberry
Pi or small Digital Ocean VPS.
